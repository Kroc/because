## Goals:
### Fast
- No title-screen, goes straight to a game (press START to open a menu)
- Instant resume: no need to "save", just power off
### Designed for Real Hardware
- Long battery life; power-down the CPU when idling / no idle animation
- Stick to 4 MHz on GameBoy Color
- GameBoy mono (DMG), Super GameBoy & GameBoy Color support and features
